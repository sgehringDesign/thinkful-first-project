			<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
			<p>
				From western Philadelphia I hail where in my youth I'd play upon the green 'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd by ruffians contemptible and mean.Although the spat was trivial and brief, it wounded my dear mother deep within; and so, to give her conscience sweet relief, she sent me forth to live amongst her kin. When to my port of call I'd been conveyed, I came upon a coachman most unique; and yet, I simply took the trip and paid, despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique. I survey all the land with princely mien in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.
